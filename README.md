# Langchain-Streamlit-conversational-Interface-for-LLMs
This repo is for the demonstration of creating a user interface and front end using Streamlit and streaming responses from language models (LLMs) as they are generated. 

I develop here an interactive user interface for a real-time conversational application using GPT.
In this I have used streaming from the LLM using write_Stream to make the response to prompts seem more snappy and instantaneous.

Chat history retention for context has been used as the user inputs messages to the LLM.
